# Amazon Location Service Samples

## Introduction

This is a set of sample applications for Amazon Location Service. For more information, please
consult the [Amazon Location Service Developer
Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide).

## Helper Libraries

[Amazon Location Helpers](amazon-location-helpers/)
([`amazon-location-helpers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-location-helpers)) is a JavaScript
library that streamlines the use of [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/)
with Amazon Location Service.

[Amazon Aurora UDFs for Amazon Location Service](aurora-udfs/) is a set of [AWS Lambda and
user-defined
functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/PostgreSQL-Lambda.html) for
[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/postgresql-features/) that enable
querying [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) using SQL. These facilitate
cleaning, validating, and enriching data in place.
